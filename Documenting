Day 1: started the project on 30th of december 2025. created the html file simple a container with cooked written on it and about the site, buttons and where it shows the result. then comes styling with linear gradient background similar to spotify's color palette. learned css again coz i forgot everything.

Day 2: worked on the js created variable to get elements from html, roast button, loading text and the roast output. adding an event listener to the roast button while clicking the button we first clear the text content of the output and remove the hidden loading text to make it visible. and also an important thing to disable the button to prevent spam clicks. for now im just adding a fake analysis by using set time out we first make the fake roast text, then hide the loading text and show the fake roast then enable the roast button again to click for another roast,  the timeout will be around 2 secs long. and that pretty much it for today.

Day 3: from the backend stage onward, I set up a node.js server using express to act as the middle layer between the frontend and external services. I created a server.js file, initiliazed a Node project, and defined basic API routes such as / to test whether the server as running and /roast to return a JSON reponse. While doing this, I encountered an error related to node:events, which turned out to be a node.js version compatibility issue, my system was using node v14, while the latest express expected a newer version. instead  of upgrading node, i resolved this by installing a node-14 compatible version of express and also reinstalled dependencies.

After the backend was runnning, i connected the frontend to it using the fetch() API, which led to several browser related errors. First, i encountered an SSL error because the frontend was trying to make an HTTPS request while the backend was running on HTTP, which i fixed by correcting the protocol. then i ran into CORS errors because the frontned HTML file was being opened directly from the file syste (file://), which browsers treat as an untrust origin. to solve this properly, i served the frontend files directly from the express backend using express.static, allowing both fontend and backend to run under the same orgin(http://localhost:300) and eliminating CORS issues. Finally, when the server complained that it could not find the cors module, resolved it by installing the missing dependecy. By the end of this process, the backend was successfully serving the frontend and handling API requests, and the full frontend-backend flow was working as expected.

day 4: today i integrated google gemini into the backend, learning how to securely use API keys with environmental variablesm how to make server side API calls, and how to debug backend only errors like 500, DNS resolution failures and deprecated model endpoints. when model erros appeared due to API changes, instead of guessing, i verified the available models ourselves using the gemini models listing API  and confirmed which ones supported generateContent. by the end of the session ,the backend was successully calling a valid gemini model and returning AI-generated roasts to the frontend, giving a working end to end AI web app
