Day 1: started the project on 30th of december 2025. created the html file simple a container with cooked written on it and about the site, buttons and where it shows the result. then comes styling with linear gradient background similar to spotify's color palette. learned css again coz i forgot everything.
Day 2: worked on the js created variable to get elements from html, roast button, loading text and the roast output. adding an event listener to the roast button while clicking the button we first clear the text content of the output and remove the hidden loading text to make it visible. and also an important thing to disable the button to prevent spam clicks. for now im just adding a fake analysis by using set time out we first make the fake roast text, then hide the loading text and show the fake roast then enable the roast button again to click for another roast,  the timeout will be around 2 secs long. and that pretty much it for today.
